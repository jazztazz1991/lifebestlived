For this site we created a responsive site to allow users to users to find local events near them that will help them focus on living a healthier life.   The site includes blogs and recipes that correlate to allow users to easily find the recipes that are mentioned in the blog.

This site utilizes google calendar api as well as animate.css library to create a beautiful and easy to use site for the end user and admin. We use a mvc paradigm to have a clean file system.

For future development we plan on increasing functionality for the user and ease of site maintenance for the admin.
